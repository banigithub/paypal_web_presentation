•History
PayPal was founded and established by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, Luke Nosek, and Ken Howerty in December 1998, which was originally called as "Confinity".
Early History
PayPal has been expanding its business since 2000, including launching business in other countries, and adding monetary unit other than US dollars, including Pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, and so on.
Later October, Confinity merged with X.com and was renamed "PayPal" in 2001 and expanded rapidly until company executives decided to go IPO.
eBay subsidiary (2002-2014)
Shortly after PayPal's IPO, the company was acquired by eBay in July 2002 for $1.5 billion, with a valuation of over $23 a share, or 77% above the IPO price. More than 70 percent of all eBay auctions accepted PayPal payments, and roughly 1 in 4 closed auction listings were transacted via PayPal. PayPal became the main payment method used by a majority of eBay users.
In March 2002, two PayPal users sued PayPal for violating the Electronic Money Laundering Act(EFTA) and California Law, however, PayPal denied all charges. The two lawsuits were subsequently merged into one joint prosecution. PayPal filled an informal settlement in November 2003, and signed an official settlement on June 11th,2004, changed operations to meet the e-Fund Sending and Compensation Frozen customers 9.25 million US dollars.
PayPal acquired the VeriSign payment solution in 2005 to expand its e-commerce business and provide added security support. In 2007, PayPal announced a partnership with MasterCard that led to the development and launch of the PayPal Secure Card service, a software that allows customers to make payments on websites that do not accept PayPal directly by generating a unique, single-use MasterCard number for each checkout. By the end of 2007, the company generated $1.8 billion in revenue.
By 2010, PayPal had over 100 million active user accounts in 190 markets through 25 different currencies. In July 2011, fourteen alleged members of the Anonymous hacktivist group were charged with attempting to disrupt PayPal's operations. The denial of service attacks occurred in December 2010, after PayPal stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks. On December 5, 2013, 13 of the PayPal 14 pleaded guilty to misdemeanour and felony charges related to the attacks. 
The company continued to build its Merchant Services division, providing e-payments for retailers on eBay. In 2011, PayPal announced that it would begin moving its business offline so that customers can make payments via PayPal in stores. In August 2012, the company announced its partnership with Discover Card to allow PayPal payments to be made at any of the 7 million stores in Discover Card's network. By the end of 2012, PayPal's total payment volume processed was $145,000,000,000, and accounted for 40% of eBay's revenue, amounting to $1,370,000,000 in the 3rd quarter of 2012.
In June 2014 David Marcus announced he was leaving his role as PayPal President, who joined PayPal in August 2011 after its acquisition of Zong, of which he was the founder and CEO. David Marcus succeeded Scott Thompson as president, and would be succeeded by Dan Schulman, who previously served as CEO of Virgin Mobile and Executive vice president of American Express.

•Features
Features

Highly-experienced fraud prevention team helps keep fraudulent buyers out of the PayPal network.

Disadvantages
PayPal can immediately freeze your account and hold your money.
When your account is frozen It might take a while till PayPal decides to release your funds.
And might leave you with very limited options and without proper explanation.
For eBay seller, sellers may not have immediate access to those funds. PayPal may hold payments for 21 days in case there is a problem with your transaction.
Sellers who have not had much activity, have a history of chargebacks or who sell certain kinds of materials such as electronics, gift cards and event tickets may be prone to being put on such an administrative hold. 


•Security
Buyers(payers) protecting principle: PayPal will freeze the funds for no reason and return immediately if the payer has already paid but later appeals. After both parties agree on their own terms, re-pay can be selected. But this is often used by fraudsters, so trading outside of eBay is insecure.
Limit or freeze accounts: the minimum limit is not to cancel the account. When account is frozen, payer can only receive money, cannot do payment or withdraw. PayPal will help solve this problem, but it takes long time to wait. The longest limitation is 180 days, which deals primarily with infringement and transactions that violate the law.
Information Review: PayPal strictly reviews user's personal data, the purpose is to prohibit money laundering or capital flows to terrorists, or North Korea, Iran and other countries. If the account involves businesses, organizations and other properties, will be required to upload tax receipts, addresses and other proofs. Once pass the due date, account will be frozen. The more advanced accounts are, the more reviews they get. Individual accounts are generally seldom reviewed. PayPal also often check the IP address when the user logs in to prevent the account from being stolen.  As usual, changing the IP will be limited (even frozen). Although this can be effective, people who often uses mobile devices or surrounding Wi-Fi to access the Internet can be limited. This is quite inconvenient.
Partnership
PayPal is one of the world's largest Internet payment companies. The company operates as a payment processor for online vendors, auction sites and other commercial users, for which it charges a small fee in exchange for benefits such as one-click transactions and password memory.
